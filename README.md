# Implementing a geometric application using Two-dimensional-tree

In this project we accomplish the following tasks:
<li> Read the csv file and construct a 2d spacial tree.
<li> Implement tree traversal algorithms like: (pre,post,in,level,reverseLevel) order traversal to view the data
<li> Implement functionalities like : range_search, nearest neighbor
<li> We construct a KML file to view the results in GIS tools like google earth
